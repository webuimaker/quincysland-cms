Take in the amazing mountain views from your own slice of heaven in the Deming Ranchettes subdivision of southwestern New Mexico! This property is just southeast of Deming, and only a 15 minutes drive to the middle of town! 

Easy access to town using maintained dirt roads in the subdivision and paved roads closer to town. Jumping on Interstate 10 is easy too, at only 15 minutes from the property. 

Deming isnâ€™t the only place nearby. Travel 15 minutes east and you will find hiking trails and beautiful wildflower displays at Rock Hound State Park, with stunning views of the Little Florida Mountains. Another great destination for the nature enthusiast is the Gila National Forest, which is just shy of 90 minutes away. If cities are more your thing, consider a 90 minute drive to El Paso, TX or a 3 hour drive to Tucson, AZ.

We have 3 adjoining half acre lots for sale that we are selling together. These are undeveloped lots that can be used for building or a place to RV/Tent. These are residentially zoned lots for Single Family Residences. Utilities are in the area with electricity being right down the road (only a third of a mile away!) Water and Septic would have to be installed for building to occur. If Water and Septic are put in, you can stay in an RV up to 240 days each year. Without these utilities you are able to stay for 30 days per year. Come stay for the winter, or stay a lifetime!
