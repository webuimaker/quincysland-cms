## How does purchasing a property from your site work?
The process is very simple. When you click a **Reserve Now** button you'll be taken to our
payment gateway to pay your down payment. We'll also collect your contact info. Once we
receive your info we'll immediately get started preparing your paperwork:
either a Deed or a Land Contract for Deed. We'll send the forms to you to sign digitally
through your email address. After you sign, we'll sign and we'll be good to go!

## How do I apply for owner financing?
There is NO application process! No credit checks. You are already pre-approved.
**If you can afford the down payment, Iâ€™ll finance you.**

## Why should I buy from Quincy's Land instead of Craigslist or eBay?
Price, quality, simplicity and trust. There are a lot of land sellers, but none have as simple and transparent a buying process as ours. Our land has been handpicked for to provide you with the best value for your money.

## Are you a real estate agent?
I am not! We own the land on our site 100% and do not pay a Real Estate Agent to market
our properties. You are dealing directly with the owner! An agent's fees can range from 5% to 8% of the 
purchase price. Quincy's Land eliminates the middleman, **saving you even more**.

## Can you help me look for a specific kind of property?
Absolutely! Please use the [Contact Us](/contact/) form to tell us what you are looking for.
We'll get back to you within 24 hours to discuss what we can find for you.

## Are there any hidden fees when buying land from you?
No! We are always upfront about our fees and they are documented in any contract we sign.
We **really don't like fees** ourselves. Types of fees we may charge include: Pro-rated taxes,
Pro-rated Home Owners Association fees, or note servicing fees.

## Why are your properties so cheap?
We search our land from motivated sellers and buy the land cheap ourselves. We then are able
to turn around and sell you the property for below market values. We [want you to get a deal](/about/)
just like we did. :)

## How do I know if this is a safe way to purchase a property?
We only use PCI compliant payment methods to collect your funds. This ensures that we are a business in good standing.

When buying land there are a few things you should always do, wether you buy from us or not:
1. Verify current ownership of the land. You can do this by calling the County Assessor. We include the County Assessor Number on all of our property pages.
2. Check for any back-taxes by calling the County Treasurer as listed on the property page. When you buy from Quincy's Land, we will
always pay the taxes before deeding the property to you.
3. Determine how you can use the property by calling the Planning & Zoning department. Make sure you have the APN ready!
4. Use Google to research the area around the property.

## Do you have a refund policy?
**YES!** If you buy a property from us, you get 100% Satisfaction, 90-day Money Back Guarantee: Quincy's Land will allow an additional inspection period of 90 days from date of down payment. If, for whatever reason, buyer is unsatisfied with the property, then Quincy's Land agrees to either exchange said property, or refund all monies minus closing costs, payment fees and accounting setup fees.
