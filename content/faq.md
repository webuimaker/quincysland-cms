## How does the process work when selling my land to you?
The process is very simple. You can either fill out the fast offer form or give us a call to give us information about the land you want to sell. If the land is one that would fit our investment criteria we will schedule to see the land. When we meet you at the land, we walk through and look at what improvements or other changes are necessary. Using this information, we can usually make you an offer on the spot. If we come to an agreement on a price, we will draw up a contract that is then taken to a title company. The title company prepares for the closing. You receive your money for the land at the closing and you're done!
## Do you buy land that needs a lot of improvements?
Of course. Most of the land we buy need improvements. Those are the ones we actually prefer. Don't worry about any level of improvements. We can handle anything.
## Do you buy land that does not need any improvements?
If you have land that does not need repairs, don't worry, we also buy those.
## How long does it take to get an offer?
This typically happens within 24 hours if you are able to provide enough information on the property.
## How long does it take to sell my land and get the money?
If absolutely necessary, we can close in as fast as 3 days. Typically, we schedule closing for 2-3 weeks but are willing to set it to be whenever is convenient for you. So whether you want to close within a week or a month, we can usually accommodate it.
## Are there any fees if I sell my land to you?
We do NOT charge fees to you to buy your land. We make our money with the investment and do not need to make any by charging you a commission.
## If I request an offer from you, am I obligated to sell you my land?

Absolutely not! You have nothing to lose. It doesn't hurt to see what we can offer you for your land. So why not give us a call?
